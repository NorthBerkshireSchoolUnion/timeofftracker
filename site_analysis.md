  - Dashboard rendering
- **data.js**: Contains mock data including:
  - Employee information
  - Time-off requests

## User Management Functionality Analysis

### Current Implementation

The user management functionality is implemented as a tab within the Settings section. Key components include:

1. **User List Table**:
   - Displays basic user information: name, email, role, status
   - Shows 2 hardcoded users (Admin User and HR Manager)
   - Includes action buttons for editing and password management

2. **User Actions**:
   - Edit button (pencil icon)
   - Password management button (key icon)
   - "Add User" button at the bottom of the list

3. **Employee Modal**:
   - Used for adding and editing employees/users
   - Contains fields for personal information, department, position, and time-off allocations
   - Missing specific user account fields like password and role selection

### Identified Issues

1. **UI/UX Problems**:
   - No search functionality for users
   - No filtering options for the user list
   - No pagination for the user list
   - No bulk actions for managing multiple users
   - No visual indication of user roles in the list view
   - "Add User" button is present in HTML but may not be properly connected to JavaScript functionality

2. **Functional Limitations**:
   - No code found to dynamically populate the user list (appears to be hardcoded)
   - Limited or no user role management functionality
   - No password management implementation despite having a button for it
   - No user import/export functionality
   - No bulk operations for managing multiple users
   - Employee modal lacks role selection field
   - Employee modal lacks password field for new users

3. **Missing Features**:
   - No CSV/TXT import functionality for users
   - No user data export functionality
   - No user filtering or search capability
   - No user permissions management
   - No user activity logs or history

4. **Inconsistencies**:
   - The modal is labeled "Employee Modal" but used for user management
   - Mixing of "employee" and "user" terminology throughout the interface
   - Action buttons use icons without text labels or tooltips
   - Required fields in the modal are marked but validation may be incomplete

## Department to District Changes

The following references to "Department" need to be changed to "District":

### HTML References (4):
- "All Departments" in dropdown option
- "Department" column header in table
- "Department" label for form field
- "Select Department" placeholder in dropdown

### JavaScript References (5):
- Department filter functionality
- Department cell creation and population
- Department filtering logic

### Data.js References (6):
- Department property in employee objects
- Department options array

## Dashboard Implementation Details

The current dashboard implementation includes:

1. **Stats Cards**:
   - 6 cards showing different time-off metrics
   - Each card has an icon, title, value, and label
   - Cards use animation effects when loaded

2. **Dashboard Grid**:
   - 4 grid items in a responsive layout:
     - Upcoming time-off
     - Team calendar
     - Recent requests
     - Time-off summary
   - Each grid item is a card with header, content, and footer sections

3. **Current Limitations**:
   - No customization options for the dashboard
   - No drag-and-drop functionality for rearranging widgets
   - No options to add, remove, or resize widgets
   - No user-specific dashboard preferences
   - No data visualization options or chart customization
