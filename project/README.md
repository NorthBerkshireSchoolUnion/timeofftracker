## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture
The application follows a modular architecture with separate components for:
- User interface (HTML/CSS)
- Application logic (JavaScript)
- Data management (JavaScript with local storage)

### Data Structure
- Employee data includes personal information and time-off balances
- Time-off requests track type, dates, status, and approval information
- Application settings store user preferences and system configurations

### Key Components
1. **Data Module** (`data.js`): Manages data storage and retrieval
2. **Application Module** (`app.js`): Implements core application functionality
3. **UI Components**: Responsive interface elements built with HTML5 and CSS3

### Storage
The prototype uses browser local storage to persist data between sessions, simulating a database backend.

## Sample User Scenarios

### HR Manager
1. Log in to the system
2. Review pending time-off requests on the dashboard
3. Approve or deny requests based on team coverage
4. Generate reports on time-off usage by department

### Employee
1. Log in to the system
2. Check remaining time-off balances
3. Submit a new vacation request
4. View status of pending requests

### Department Manager
1. Log in to the system

3. Plan projects around team availability
4. Approve time-off requests from direct reports

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with calendar systems (Google Calendar, Outlook)
- Email notifications for request status changes
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Mobile application for on-the-go access
